# Brain-Cancer-Classification-using-CNN-VGG-Logistic-Regression-and-SVM-best-practice
 The goal of this project is to create a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model capable of classifying a brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) into four categories. We will start with a basic model and then apply transfer learning to improve accuracy. The concept is that accuracy will enhance at each stage of the process.
